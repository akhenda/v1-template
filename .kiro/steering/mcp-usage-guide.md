# üß© MCP Servers Usage Guide

This document provides guidance on when and how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers available in this project. MCP gives you access to structured tools and resources beyond plain text context.

## üéØ General Decision Flow

Choose **one server at a time** that best fits your request. Only chain servers if absolutely necessary.

1. **Need real-time web search or deep research?** ‚Üí Use **Exa**
2. **Need official documentation or library references?** ‚Üí Use **Ref**
3. **Need semantic code understanding/editing in this repo?** ‚Üí Use **Serena**
4. **Need security scanning or vulnerability analysis?** ‚Üí Use **Semgrep**

> **Important**: Only use activated MCP servers. If a server is disabled in config, request enablement before attempting to use it.

## üîç Ref (Documentation Search)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVATED**

**Purpose**: Lightning-fast search and selective reading over public/private API & library documentation to minimize tokens and reduce hallucination.

**Core Tools**:

- `ref_search_documentation(query)` - Search documentation
- `ref_read_url(url)` - Fetch and markdown-convert specific documentation pages

**When To Use**:

- Need authoritative reference material (API endpoints, SDK usage, library options)
- Looking for specific implementation details from official docs
- Want to avoid hallucination by grounding responses in real documentation
- Need to understand framework-specific patterns or best practices

**Strategy**:

1. Start with a natural-language question
2. If answer is incomplete, refine query or read additional URLs
3. Ref de-duplicates content across the session for efficiency

**Example Usage**:

```txt
Search Next.js App Router data fetching patterns and read the relevant documentation to understand server components vs client components.

Search Convex query optimization best practices and extract performance recommendations.

Find Tailwind CSS 4 configuration options for custom design tokens.
```

**Avoid Using For**:

- Generic web research (use Exa instead)
- Real-time information that changes frequently
- Content that's not in official documentation

## üåê Exa (Real-Time Web & Deep Research)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVATED**

**Purpose**: Real-time web search, academic research, company information, GitHub repositories, LinkedIn profiles, Wikipedia articles, competitor analysis, and long-running deep research workflows.

**Core Tools**:

- `web_search_exa` - General web search
- `research_paper_search_exa` - Academic paper search
- `company_research_exa` - Company information research
- `crawling_exa` - Extract content from specific URLs
- `competitor_finder_exa` - Find business competitors
- `linkedin_search_exa` - LinkedIn profile/company search
- `wikipedia_search_exa` - Wikipedia article search
- `github_search_exa` - GitHub repository search
- `deep_researcher_start` - Start comprehensive research task
- `deep_researcher_check` - Check status of deep research

**When To Use**:

- Need up-to-date information not in documentation
- Researching market trends, competitors, or industry insights
- Looking for code examples or open-source solutions
- Conducting comprehensive multi-source research
- Need to understand current best practices or emerging patterns

**Strategy**:

- **For quick answers**: Use specific search tools (`web_search_exa`, `github_search_exa`, etc.)
- **For complex investigations**: Use `deep_researcher_start` with detailed question, then poll `deep_researcher_check` until complete

**Example Usage**:

```txt
Search GitHub for React resume builder components with TypeScript and extract implementation patterns.

Research current ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimization trends in 2024 and summarize key findings.

Use deep_researcher_start to investigate "best practices for AI-powered document analysis in web applications" and provide comprehensive analysis.

Find competitors to ResumeMoto in the AI resume optimization space.
```

**Best Practices**:

- Be specific in your queries for better results
- Use deep researcher for complex, multi-faceted questions
- Combine with other tools when you need both research and implementation

## ü§ñ Serena (Code Indexing & Editing)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVATED**

**Purpose**: Semantic code retrieval and agentic editing over the local codebase. Provides deep understanding of the repository structure and enables intelligent code modifications.

**Core Capabilities**:

- Semantic code search and navigation
- Multi-file refactoring and editing
- Code structure analysis and understanding
- Symbol finding and reference tracking
- Intelligent code generation within project context

**When To Use**:

- Need to understand how specific features are implemented
- Looking for where certain functionality is located
- Want to make changes across multiple files consistently
- Need to understand code relationships and dependencies
- Refactoring existing code while maintaining consistency
- Adding new features that integrate with existing codebase

**Strategy**:

- Always start the session by running, "Read Serena's initial instructions" OR `/mcp__serena__initial__instructions`
- Ask direct, specific questions about code location and implementation
- Request modifications with clear context about desired changes
- Use for understanding complex code relationships
- Leverage for maintaining coding standards across the project

**Example Usage**:

```txt

Read Serena's initial instructions.

Find where the ATS scoring algorithm is implemented and explain how it calculates the overall score.

Locate all components that handle resume parsing and show their relationships.

Refactor the AI provider integration to support the new Anthropic Claude API while maintaining backward compatibility.

Add error handling to all database operations in the Convex functions following the project's error handling patterns.

Show me how the subscription billing system integrates with the AI credit system.
```

**Best Practices**:

- Be specific about what you're looking for or want to change
- Provide context about the broader goal when requesting modifications
- Ask for explanations of complex code relationships
- Use for maintaining consistency with existing patterns

## üõ°Ô∏è Semgrep (Security Scanning)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVATED**

**Purpose**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and custom rule authoring. Provides comprehensive security scanning and AST inspection capabilities.

**Core Tools**:

- `security_check` - Fast security vulnerability scan
- `semgrep_scan` - Comprehensive code analysis
- `semgrep_scan_with_custom_rule` - Scan with custom rules
- `get_abstract_syntax_tree` - AST analysis for specific code
- `semgrep_rule_schema` - Get rule schema for custom rules
- `get_supported_languages` - Check supported languages

**When To Use**:

- After generating or modifying code (especially AI-generated)
- Before committing changes to ensure security
- When user explicitly requests security review
- Need to create custom security rules for project-specific patterns
- Analyzing code structure for potential vulnerabilities
- Ensuring compliance with security best practices

**Workflow**:

1. Run `security_check` or `semgrep_scan` on relevant code
2. Analyze findings and prioritize by severity
3. If needed, create custom rules with `semgrep_scan_with_custom_rule`
4. Provide remediation advice for identified issues

**Example Usage**:

```txt
Scan the AI package for security vulnerabilities and provide remediation recommendations.

Check the authentication system for common security issues like SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities.

Create a custom Semgrep rule to detect improper API key handling in our codebase.

Analyze the file upload functionality for potential security risks.

```

**Best Practices**:

- Always scan AI-generated code before integration
- Focus on high and critical severity findings first
- Create custom rules for project-specific security patterns
- Provide clear remediation steps for identified issues
- Regular security scans should be part of the development workflow
